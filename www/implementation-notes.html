<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>In the very first formulation of this service, all PDFs were scraped up by to a local folder via the 'wget' program on OS X. Those PDFs were all converted to HTML with 'pdftohtml' (OS X) so that they could be indexed.</p>

<p>Since then, a sync program has been written in python that processes any new documents available on the original site and converts them to be added to the search index.</p>

<p>Xapian is the underlying search engine framework, and Omega is the layer above it that provides indexing control via 'omindex'.
</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>boolean searching<br/><b>done.</b></li>
<li>replace the indexer with a much better one<br/><b>done.</b></li>
<li>fix text encoding errors when converting to HTML<br/><b>done.</b></li>
<li>have proper titles and link to the original PDF<br/><b>done.</b></li>
<li>highlight terms in proper context with page reference in PDF<br/><b>done (in HTML).</b></li>
<li>result counts by important terms<br/><b>done.</b></li>
<li>tag clouds by term frequencies</li>
</ul>
Most importantly it's a question of what's needed. Send me ideas.
